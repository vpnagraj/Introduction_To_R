  Output: "Welcome. This is the second lesson ('Functions') in the 'Introduction To R' swirl course. We'll briefly introduce the syntax for calling R's built-in functions, and also show you how to get help interactively."

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: "In the first lesson we covered how to do some basic math ... division, subtraction, multiplication, etc. R has built in functions to perform more complex operations. For example, log(100) will give you the log of 100. Try it out and let's see what that value is."
  CorrectAnswer: log(100)
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr="log(100)")
  Hint: "To call a function type it's name, then the argument in parentheses."

- Class: text
  Output: "You may or may not have noticed something that the output from log(100) gives you the natural log of 100. But what if you wanted to compute the common (base 10) log?"

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: "To find out more about function you can consult the help documentation. Typing ?log or help(log) will bring up the help file for the log function. Go for it."
  CorrectAnswer: ?log
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr="?log")
  Hint: "To access help documentation for a specific function type ?INSERTFUNCTIONNAMEHERE or help(INSERTFUNCTIONNAMEHERE"

- Class: text
  Output: "If you're in RStudio you should have the help file for log open in the 'Help' pane. As you can see, the documentation gives a brief description of the function, details, references and some examples of usage."

- Class: text
  Output: "The help file also describes what arguments can be passed to the function. In this case we were originally only a single argument to the log function. But as the documentation explains, we can calculate a log of a specific base by adding a second argument. For example, log(80,3) would give us log of 80 with base=3."

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: "Let's see what the log of 100 with base=10 is ..."
  CorrectAnswer: log(100,10)
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr="log(100,10)")
  Hint: "To compute the log with base=10 you can either specify a base argument to the log function or use the log10 function. ?log will show you the syntax for both methods."

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: "Awesome. Hopefully you've seen how useful the help documentation for functions can be. The last thing to do is look at the documentation for the seq function, which we will be using in the next lesson. Go ahead and pull up the help file for seq."
  CorrectAnswer: ?seq
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr="?seq")
  Hint: "To access help documentation for a specific function type ?INSERTFUNCTIONNAMEHERE or help(INSERTFUNCTIONNAMEHERE"

- Class: text
  Output: "Alright. That's the end of the 'Functions' lesson, let's review ... "

- Class: text
  Output: "First we used a simple math function ... "

- Class: text
  Output: "Then we learned how to access the help documentation for a function ... "

- Class: text
  Output: "Last of all we passed an extra argument to change how the function default."
